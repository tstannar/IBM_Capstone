Eventually I would like to get a house that balances relatively low cost, good nearby gyms and restaurants, and good schools. For this I will combine Foursquare API and house price and school data to find the optimum spot to wait for a house to sell, then buy it if I have enough money.
I will combine foursquare API for the restaurant and gym data with Zillow house price data and US census school data.
